Navigating with the terminal

ls - lists all contents of our home directory

*you can also use ls as an argument* *you can also pass two arguments with ls and it will display the contents of both directories* (using absolute or relative paths)
example: "ls Documents" - this would display all the contents of the Documents folder
example: "ls /Users/js/Documents"
example: "ls ~/Documents"
*be sure to type in the right case since it is case sensitive

pwd (print working directory) - returns working directory name

Accessing directories with a space between the words or letters requires it to be in quotations or a back slash as follows
example: ls "Some Directory"
example: ls Some\ Directory

Passing options to our ls command
*you can combine these commands by just listing them out as follows...
ls -t -l -a
*this command will list the files as last modified (-t), give you a detailed list (-l), and last but not least display every file including hidden files (-a)

*an alternative with the same output that I find more efficient is the command...
ls -tla (order doesn't matter)

ls -l - gives you a detailed list of your home directory

ls -a - lists all files in home directory

ls -t - sorts files by the time they were last modified

Changing directories

cd - command  changes directory with given name of directory after

cd .. = moves one level up

cd . = represents our current Directory
