Ethical Hacking

Hacking - any system(doesn't have to be electronic) that you alter to do something you intended rather than what it was designed to do

how to penetrate networks, exploit systems, compromise routers, etc.

Basic Terminology

White Hat = good

Grey Hat = in between

Black Hat = bad

Footprinting - info gathering, conducting recon work, ip server, which ports are open, not confined to digital world

DoS (just you) = denial of service; perform requests than a server can handle and server begins to drop connections

DDoS (multiple people) =

FUD (anti-virus can not detect) = Fully Undetectable; not labeled something malicious by antivirus programs

RAT = Remote Administration Tools

Fishing = when you get an email with a link provided and it throws you somewhere that is not something legit where you pass credentials(possibly)

SQL Injections = simply pass SQL queries to https requests

VPN = Virtual Private Networks, anonymizing you and the VPN provider heavily encrypted

Proxy = a less reliable way of staying anon and make it a common practice to use socks 5 proxies

Tor = free open source, faster than proxies but not proxies, gives ability to route traffic through certain routes and routers/devices on the internet for packets and connection to go through (very hard to detect)

VPS = Virtual Private Servers(can be viewed as a security server)

Key Loggers = tools used to steal credentials, extract info, can configure to record all keystrokes and send.

Terminal = an interface that allows you to control your OS

Linux Terminal

Firewall =

Linux Firewall = close open ports, close connections, forbid protocols, forwarding, redirection, etc.

Root kit = a tool which you install onto an OS that is able to hide running processes from the system itself, (redirects requests)

Reverse-shells = a program which you infect another device, and that program opens up a reverse connection from the device back to you

*be sure to check running processes in the background from the task manager
*http or https
*never ever run an uncompiled binary source on your computer that isn't open sourced
*sometimes you need to break into the router first
