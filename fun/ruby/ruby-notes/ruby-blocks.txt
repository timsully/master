//Blocks
Calculating the sum of a list of numbers. Example:

numbers = [5, 2, 8]
sum = 0
numbers.each do |n|
  sum += n
end
puts sum

The example above is a reminder of the proper syntax.

//Sorting
Using the .sort! method to sort an array in descending
order(in reverse) can use the combined comparison
operator (<=>) or an if/elsif/else statement.

//Sorting w/ Control Flow
Example below:

def alphabetize(arr, rev = false)
  arr.sort!
  if rev == true
    arr.reverse!
  else
  	arr
  end
end

numbers = [3, 5, 1, 6]

puts alphabetize(numbers)

In the example above we create an array called numbers.
Then, we create an array. Finally, we print out 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

**Building your own methods is great for using code
over and over without having to retype things, but it's
also great for abstracting or simplifying your program.
Once you write alphabetize, you don't ever have to think
about how it works -- you just call it whenever you need it.
