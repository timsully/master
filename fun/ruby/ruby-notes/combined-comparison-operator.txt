//The Combined Comparison Operator
We can also use a new operator called the combined comparison operator
to compare two Ruby objects. The combined comparison operator to compare
two Ruby objects. The combined comparison operator looks like this: <=>
It returns 0 if the first operand(item to be compared) equals the second,
1 if the first operand is greater than the second, and -1 if the first
operand is less than the second.

A block that is passed into the sort method must return either 1, 0, or -1.
It should return -1 if the first block parameter should come before the
second, 1 if vice versa, and 0 if they are of equal weight, meaning one
does not come before the other (i.e. if two values are equal) Example:

book_1 = "A Wrinkle in Time"

book_2 = "A Brief History of Time"

book_1 <=> book_2
