//Getting the User's Input
puts "Enter some text: "
text = gets.chomp

puts "Enter words to redact: "
redact = gets.chomp

//The .split Method
Divide the user's input into individual words with .split which takes a string and returns an array
//example
text.split(",")
this tells Ruby to split up the string text whenever it sees a comma
