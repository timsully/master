//Sorting the Hash
We have a hash full of word / frequency key-value pairs.
Now we need to figure out a way to get our information in
the order we want it. Example below:

colors = {
  "blue" => 3,
  "green" => 1,
  "red" => 2
}
colors = colors.sort_by do |color, count|
  count
end
colors.reverse!

In the example above, we first create a hash called colors
that maps color strings to numbers. Then, we sort colors into
green, red, and blue, from smallest to largest by count. Just
so you know, the .sort_by function returns and array of arrays.
but that's fine. Finally, we reverse the array order so that
the colors with the largest counts are first.
