//Iterating Over the Hash
Iterate over the array to print out each key-value
pair to the console. Example below:

fruit = {
  "apple" => 2,
  "banana" => 3,
  "cherry" => 5
}

fruit.each do |name, count|
  puts name + " " + count.to_s
end

In the example above, we create a hash called fruit
that maps names of fruit to the amount that we own.
Then we iterate over .each key/value pair, storing
the key as name and the value as count. Finally, we
print out the key and value separated by a space.
Note that we must first convert the value from a
number to a string using .to_s before we can
concatenate it.
