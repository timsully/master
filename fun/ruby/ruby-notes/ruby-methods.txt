///What is a Method?
A method is a reusable section of code written
to perform a specific task in a program. You might
be wondering why you need to separate your code into
methods, rather than just writing everything out in
one big chunk. It turns out there are a few good
reasons to divide your programs into methods:

1. If something goes wrong in your code, it's much
easier to find and fix bugs if you've organized your
program well. Assigning specific tasks to separate
methods helps this organization.

2. By assigning specific tasks to separate methods
(an idea computer scientists call separation of concerns),
you make your program less redundant and your code
more reusable---not only can you repeatedly use the
same method in a single program without rewriting it
each time, but you can even use that method in another
program.

3. When we learn more about objects, you'll find out
there are a lot of interesting things we can do with
methods in Ruby.
