If we were to hand you five books and ask you to arrange them, sorted
by title, on a shelf, how would you do it?

Most sorting algorithms assume we are sorting an array of items, which
involves comparing any two items in the array and deciding which should
come first.

For our books example, if for any pair we always chose the book whose
title came first in the alphabet, we could devise a strategy for
sorting. These "strategies" are the sorting algorithms mentioned in the
previous example. Our job is to decide how to compare two items in the
list, and let Ruby decide which strategy to use. Example below:

We can create a variable called books in order to sort the list of books
alphabetically. Example: books.sort!
